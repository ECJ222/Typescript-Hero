/*
* AAAADV what? yeah Advanced type inference, let me explain what it is.
* Advanced type inference refers to the typing system of which typescript 
* can be used to detect the types at compile time in order to prevent unwanted errors.
* For example: Did you know types could be detected all the way at the object level? üòâ
* Let's say you had a function who's parameter takes in an object called data.
* With typescript you can let your compiler know what types to expect in that data simply by inferening them üôÇ.
*/
// Let me show you:
Interface DataType {
  a: string;
  b: number;
  c?: unknown; ü•∑
}
function typeInfer (data: DataType) {
  console.log(data)
}
const data = {}
typeInfer(data) // ‚ùå Now the compiler is crying üò≠.
// If you were using an IDE that supports typescript like VScode, you would see DataType's types,
// When you hover over the type with your mouse.
// Neat right!

  Generics: `Generics ü§´

* You can think of generics as your special friend that can work with pretty much all data types.
* Eliminating the need for the compiler explicitly provide type inference.

* This means arg can be any type and the compiler won't complain about it being passed into the function.

* - Conditionally using types for properties based on a specific condition.
* Something cool to note is how Mapped types iteratively moves down an object.
* It uses the Propert Key gotten when the keyof keyword is used to get the key of an object.
* This then allows for the modification of the propety values as seen in the below code.
* In the code below, the Animal interface is being modified to become readonly.
